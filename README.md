# Yet Another BlueSky Feed Generator

incredibly basic bsky single feed generator, mostly made as a self-hosted
replacement for simple skyfeed.app feeds

if you want something likely to actually work use
[Bluesky's feed-generator](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator) or
[picofeedgen](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/picofeedgen) :3

## TODO

- [x] basic feed functionality
- [ ] pagination(?)

## Feeds hosted with this

(if For Some Reason you host a feed using this let me know/PR and I'll add it)

- [Fandoms I Like](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hrqwngkxqcxffdwazjgdcmfk/feed/fandoms),
  my feed with just a bunch of regex for pseudo-detecting when someone talks
  about a fandom we like
